  <p><b>How to interpret your vocabulary size score:</b></p>
  <p>This Japanese vocabulary size test contains 100 randomly selected words from a large corpus of novels, magazines, internet blogs, and other written materials.  Your score is a rough approximation of the number of words you know in Japanese*.  <br />
  <i>*If you score higher than 9,000, this vocabulary size test may not have enough advanced items to accurately estimate your score.</i></p>


  <p><b>How to interpret your vocabulary profile:</b></p>
  <p>
  Your vocabulary profile approximates the percent of words you know for each frequency band from the 1-1,000 band to the 9,001-10,000 band. The words within the 1,000 band represent some of the most frequent words used in written Japanese texts, while words in the 10,000 band level are much less frequent.  Your vocabulary profile provides a rough estimate of the percentage of words you know in each frequency band. </p>
  <br />
  <p>
  Based on your vocabulary profile, suggestions for building your Japanese vocabulary are provided below:<p>
  {% if vocabulary <= 3000 %}
    <h4>1 - 3,000 Beginner.  </h4>
    <p>
    You can read easier materials designed for beginning language learners, but you probably need a dictionary in order to read more challenging texts.  It may be difficult to find 'easy' material to read, so you should focus on building your Japanese vocabulary and grammar using Japanese learning textbooks, websites, or other material.  You might also consider reading bilingual books/comics, children's books, or online materials. To improve your reading fluency, practice reading a variety of easy material or reading the same book multiple times.

    <h4>3,001-5,000 Intermediate. </h4>
    <p> 
You can read elementary Japanese textbooks without too much need for a dictionary.  You can also understand the main ideas from Japanese children's books, but may need a dictionary to understand details.  To improve fluency, consider reading a variety of beginner materials or Japanese news written for children.  To improve your vocabulary, grammar, and overall reading comprehension skills, consider reading children's novels, short magazine articles, or Japanese blogs.</p>

To improve fluency, consider reading level books for Japanese junior high school students, news websites for children, or read more challenging books multiple times.

    <p>
    *Since the test only goes up to the 10,000 band, you may have a larger Japanese vocabulary size than this test can accurately assess.  You can read most authentic, nontechnical Japanese materials without the aid of a dictionary.  Congratulations!  To work on reading fluency, pick what interests you most.  For more challenging materials, you may choose technical or specialist topics to read about.</p>
