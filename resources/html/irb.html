<br>
You are being asked to be a volunteer in a research study. This Japanese Vocabulary Size Test is part of a research study conducted by Aurora Tsai Georgia Institute of Technology.<br>
<br>
<br>
The purpose of the research is to investigate the validity and reliability of the Japanese vocabulary size test. Vocabulary size tests are easy to administer and can provide language learners and teachers with relatively quick estimates of their vocabulary size. Many vocabulary size tests have been developed and validated for English, but none are publically available yet for Japanese.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Procedures</b><br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Online Japanese Vocabulary Size Test</i><br>
You will take an online Japanese vocabulary size test. This test is multiple choice and will provide a rough approximation of the total number of words you know in Japanese. It takes approximately 20-35 minutes.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Test Feedback and Background Questionnaire</i><br>
At the end of the Japanese Vocabulary Size Test, you will be asked 3-4 short feedback questions about your experience taking the vocabulary test. In addition, you will be asked to fill out a short background questionnaire about your language background and experiences. These surveys ask about what languages you speak, your educational background, and your experience learning and speaking Japanese.<br>
<br>
<br>
<i>Vocabulary Section of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (optional)</i><br>
After you finish the Background Questionnaire, you will be asked if you are interested in volunteering to take a section of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT). If you respond “yes”, then you will be contacted by the researcher and given instructions on how to take this test online. This test has 35 multiple choice questions taken from various levels of the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (N4, N3, and N2). It takes approximately 15 – 20 minutes and can also be completed from any computer. If you complete this activity, you will get feedback to see approximately what level of vocabulary you have in relation to the JLPT levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Participant Requirements</b><br>
To participate in this study, you must fit the following criteria:<br>
<br>
(1)   Be a learner of Japanese as an additional language.<br>
(2)   Be between 18 and 100 years old.<br>
(3)   Permit the researcher to use test scores for research purposes only.<br>
(4)   Be willing to share your de-identified (anonymized) responses for research purposes only.<br>
(5)   Be a fluent speaker of English (e.g., enrolled in a U.S. university as a regular student or native English speaker)<br>
<br>
<br> 
<b>Risks</b><br>
The risks and discomfort associated with participation in this study are no greater than those ordinarily encountered in daily life or using the computer. For example, you will be asked to click on the correct answers and read off a screen.<br>
<br>
The most foreseeable risk of participation in this study is a breach of confidentiality. In order to protect your privacy, all data will be collected by assigned numbers, not by your name. The data will be stored on the principal investigator’s secure, password protected work computer and will only be accessible by the principle investigator, the assistant investigator, and the website programmer. Finally, no unauthorized use of information will be permitted.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Benefits</b><br>
There may be no direct benefit to the participant. Participants may gain more familiarity with Japanese vocabulary as they complete the tasks. They will also receive a rough approximation of their vocabulary size in Japanese (how many words they know). If they take the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT), they will also be given feedback to understand their level of proficiency in relation to the JLPT levels.<br>
<br>
<br>
<b>Compensation & Costs</b><br>
You will be entered into a raffle for completing the online Japanese Vocabulary Size Test, for one of ten $50 Amazon gift cards. If you opt to take the Japanese Language Proficiency Test as well, you will be entered into the raffle twice. You may enter the raffle whether or not you choose to participate in the study.<br>
<br>
By participating in the study, you will be contributing to important research in the field of language learning. Your participation will help improve our ability to assess Japanese learners’ proficiency and support learners’ vocabulary development. There will be no cost to you if you participate in this study. Please note, that your responses will only be useable for the study if it shows signs of effort and no indication of cheating.<br>
<br>
<br> 
<b>Storing and Sharing Your Information</b><br>
<br>
Your participation in this study is gratefully acknowledged. It is possible that your information/data will be enormously valuable for other research purposes. By signing below, you consent for your de-identified information/data to be stored by the researcher and to be shared with other researchers in future studies. If you agree to allow such future sharing and use, your identity will be completely separated from your information/data. Future researchers will not have a way to identify you. Any future research must be approved by an ethics committee before being undertaken.<br>
<br> 
<br> 
<b>Confidentiality</b><br>
By participating in the study, you understand and agree that Georgia Institute of Technology may be required to disclose your consent form, data and other personally identifiable information as required by law, regulation, subpoena or court order. Otherwise, your confidentiality will be maintained in the following manner:<br>
<br>
Your research data will be stored in a secure location on Georgia Institute of Technology property. Sharing of data with other researchers will only be done in such a manner that you will not be identified. By participating, you understand and agree that the data and information gathered during this study may be used by Georgia Institute of Technology and published and/or disclosed by Georgia Institute of Technology to others outside of Georgia Institute of Technology. However, your name, contact information and other direct personal identifiers will not be mentioned in any such publication or dissemination of the research data and/or results by Georgia Institute of Technology. Note that per regulation all research data must be kept for a minimum of 3 years.<br>
<br>
The researcher will take the following steps to protect participants’ identities during this study:<br>
<br>
(1) Each participant will be assigned a number;<br>
(2) All data will be assigned a number, not a name;<br>
(3) Contact information and data will not be linked;<br>
(4) No unauthorized use of information will be allowed, and<br>
(5) if participants happen to reveal their real names in open-answer responses, they will NOT be used in publications and presentations.<br>
<br>
You should be aware that the experiment is not being run from a ‘secure’ https server of the kind typically used to handle credit card transactions, so there is a small possibility that responses could be viewed by unauthorized third parties such as computer hackers. In general, the web page software will log as header lines the IP address of the machine you use to access this page, e.g.,102.403.506.807, but otherwise no other information will be stored unless you explicitly enter it.<br>
